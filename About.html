<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>Hello my name is Jullian, and I am currently a student at Kennesaw State University and a Cybersecurity Major.<br>
    I am soon to graduate in May 2024 with a Bachelor of Science of Cybersecurity.
    I currently work part-time as a ramen chef but hope to <br>gain an internship or entry
    level role soon. I also hope to one day become a security analyst <br>and eventually work my way up to
    be in an administrative role within a company.<br><br>
    My two favorite things to do are playing soccer and video games! <br>I currently play soccer for a semi-pro team called
    Club the Strongest Atlanta.<br>My current favorite video game is league of legend which I have been playing for
    around 8 years now.
