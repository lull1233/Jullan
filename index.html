<!-- JavaScript to change the visibility of the navigation section using if else statement
  the script section basically says to listen for a click by the user
   then checks if the content is hidden or shown then either displays or hides the content. -->
<!-- To go line by line
1. The first line is calling on the variable declared earlier which is the togglenavbutton
variable and is adding an event which is the clicking of the button.
2. The second line gets the nav section which has all the links to the different pages.
3. Then the next lines are an if else statement hiding or showing the nav section which was created earlier. -->
<script>
    document.getElementById("toggleNavButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
        var navSection = document.getElementById("navSection");
        if (navSection.style.display === "none") {
            navSection.style.display = "block";
            document.getElementById("toggleNavButton").textContent = "Hide Navigation";
        } else {
            navSection.style.display = "none";
